# CRUD-Recipes

Fundamental Project

The proposed project that has been set out for us is “To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

Therefore, this means I will be producing an application that ensures I can create, read, update and delete. I will have to create functions for the CRUD application, this will help the understanding of what I have learnt over the last few weeks, detailing what I understood and didn’t quite understand. 

The proposed project details I should include the following:
•	A Jira board 
•	Documentation describing the architecture you will use for your project.
•	A Risk Assessment
•	A relational database. 
•	A functional application 
•	A functioning front-end website and integrated API. 
•	Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. 
•	You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage 
•	Code fully integrated into a Version Control System
•	Code built through a CI server
•	Application deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

To achieve the criteria set out in the project I will produce a Recipe application that must allow the user to interact with and do the following:
•	Create a recipe page (satisfies 'Create') that stores:
o	ID
o	Name
o	Flavour
o	Type
•	View all recipe details (satisfies 'Read') 
•	Update recipe details e.g different name (satisfies 'Update')
•	Delete recipes (satisfies 'Delete')
Database 

•	I will create a database using the H2 console as my minimum viable project 
•	If I have extra time I will use a MySQL database on Google Cloud.
•	I will have one database with the recipe features inside
•	Below is an ERD image of how I want my database to look with the attributes I would like

Project Tracking 
I used Jira to track my project, I used it to plan out each task I had to do. The board moves from left to right, once a task is in progress, I move it along to the next column. Once it is fully implemented in my application, I will move it across again to the left therefore I will know which tasks I have completed and what I have left to complete. I have attached my Jira board below.

Front End design 

The front-end design is simple. I wanted the front end to very simple to ensure I got all functionality built in. I have attached a photo of what my html front end design looks like.

Known Issues
There are a few bugs with the current build of the app:
•	If the user updates a recipe it doesn’t update it just puts the name at the bottom.
